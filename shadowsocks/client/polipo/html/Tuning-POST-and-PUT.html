<h3 class="section">3.11 Tuning POST and PUT requests</h3>

<p><a name="index-POST-request-172"></a><a name="index-PUT-request-173"></a><a name="index-expectContinue-174"></a>
The main assumption behind the design of the HTTP protocol is that
requests are idempotent: since a request can be repeated by a client,
a server is allowed to drop a connection at any time.  This fact, more
than anything else, explains the amazing scalability of the protocol.

   <p>This assumption breaks down in the case of POST requests.  Indeed, a
POST request usually causes some action to be performed (a page to be
printed, a significant amount of money to be transferred from your
bank account, or, in Florida, a vote to be registered), and such a
request should not be repeated.

   <p>The only solution to this problem is to reserve HTTP to idempotent
activities, and use reliable protocols for action-effecting ones. 
Notwithstanding that, HTTP/1.1 makes a weak attempt at making POST
requests slightly more reliable and efficient than they are in
HTTP/1.0.

   <p>When speaking to an HTTP/1.1 server, an HTTP client is allowed to
request that the server check <em>a priori</em> whether it intends to
honour a POST request.  This is done by sending <dfn>an expectation</dfn>,
a specific header with the request, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Expect: 100-continue</span></samp>&rsquo;, and
waiting for either an error message or a &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">100 Continue</span></samp>&rsquo; reply
from the server.  If the latter arrives, the client is welcome to send
the rest of the POST request<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-1" name="fnd-1"><sup>1</sup></a>.

   <p>Polipo's behaviour w.r.t. client expectations is controlled by the
variable <code>expectContinue</code>.  If this variable is false, Polipo
will never send an expectation to the server; if a client sends an
expectation, Polipo will fail the expectation straight away, causing
the client (if correctly implemented) to retry with no expectation. 
If <code>expectContinue</code> is <code>maybe</code> (the default), Polipo will
behave in a standards-compliant manner: it will forward expectations
to the server when allowed to do so, and fail client expectations
otherwise.  Finally, if <code>expectContinue</code> is <code>true</code>, Polipo
will always send expectations when it is reasonable to do so; this
violates the relevant standards and will break some websites, but
might decrease network traffic under some circumstances.

<h4>Footnotes</h4><p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-1" href="#fnd-1">1</a>]</small> This, of course, is only part of
the story.  Additionally, the server is not required to reply with
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">100 Continue</span></samp>&rsquo;, hence the client must implement a timeout. 
Furthermore, according to the obsolete RFC2068, the server is
allowed to spontaneously send &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">100 Continue</span></samp>&rsquo;, so the client must
be prepared to ignore such a reply at any time.</p>
